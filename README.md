# Connect Four

A two-player connection based game created in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS3.
The game is for two players and the goal of the game is to get four tokens of your own symbol in a row. Once one player gets four tokens in a row that player wins. If the board is full the game ends in a draw. The real game board is standing up so all the tokens fall down as far as possible.
