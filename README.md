# Connect Four - Breaking Bad Theme

A two-player connection based game created in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS3.

The goal of the game is to get four tokens of your own color in a row. Once one player gets four tokens in a row that player wins. If the board is full the game ends in a draw. The real game board is standing up so all the tokens fall down as far as possible.
